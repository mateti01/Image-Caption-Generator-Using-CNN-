🖼️ Image Caption Generator using Deep Learning
📌 Objective
To develop an end-to-end deep learning model that automatically generates human-like captions for images by combining computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image feature extraction and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for sequential caption generation.

🔄 Workflow
1. Dataset Used
Flickr8k dataset (or MS COCO)

Each image is associated with 5 human-written captions

2. Image Preprocessing
Resize images to (299, 299) (for InceptionV3)

Normalize pixel values as per the model's requirements

Example tool: InceptionV3 pre-trained on ImageNet

3. Feature Extraction
Load pre-trained InceptionV3 or VGG16 model

Remove the final classification layer

Extract a 2048-dimensional feature vector per image

Save features in a .pkl file for reuse

4. Caption Preprocessing
Load caption file (captions.txt)

Associate multiple captions with each image ID

Clean each caption:

Convert to lowercase

Remove punctuation, numbers, and short words

Add special tokens: startseq and endseq to each caption

5. Tokenizer and Vocabulary Creation
Use Tokenizer to convert words into integers

Create a vocabulary from training captions

Calculate maximum caption length for padding

6. Sequence Generation
Convert each caption into multiple input-output pairs:

Example:
Caption: startseq a dog playing endseq
Training Pairs:

Input: startseq, Output: a

Input: startseq a, Output: dog

...

Pad input sequences to max_length

7. Data Generator
Dynamically load batches of:

Image features

Corresponding padded caption sequences

Next word as target label

Efficient memory usage for large datasets

8. Model Architecture
CNN + RNN Architecture:
Image Feature Extractor:

Input: 2048-dim vector

Dense layer to reduce dimensionality

Text Sequence Model:

Embedding layer

LSTM or Bidirectional LSTM

Fusion:

Merge CNN and RNN outputs

Dense layer with Softmax to predict the next word

9. Training
Loss Function: categorical_crossentropy

Optimizer: Adam

Evaluation Metric: BLEU Score (BLEU-1 to BLEU-4)

10. Caption Generation
Techniques:
Greedy Search: Select word with highest probability at each time step

Beam Search: Keep top N sequences at each step for better quality

11. Evaluation
BLEU Score to compare generated captions against human references

Qualitative Evaluation by visual inspection of generated captions

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

InceptionV3 / VGG16

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

NLTK / re (for text cleaning)

Pickle

Tokenizer (Keras)

✅ Outcome
Built a working deep learning pipeline that generates human-like captions for unseen images.

Achieved meaningful BLEU scores for generated captions.

Successfully combined computer vision and natural language generation using CNN + RNN architecture.

Can be extended to larger datasets (like MS COCO) and transformer-based models (like ViT + GPT).

📂 Example
Input:

Generated Caption:
"A dog playing with a ball in the park."
